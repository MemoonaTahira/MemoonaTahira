### Hi there 👋

<!--
**MemoonaTahira/MemoonaTahira** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I am Memoona Tahira! I am a freelance Machine Learning engineer. I am a Computer Science Graduate, and I researched in the domain of human psychology and Computer Vision. I like learning new things, especially how to automate coding tasks so I don't have to do it manually, and also to keep things updated on their own (for as long as possible).🧶

- 🔭 I am currently working on sound classification.
- 🌱 I am currently learning with MLZoomcamp (a 4 months course by Data Talks). 
- 🐌 I am slowly mastering docker, aws, streamlit, git, unit testing and pydoc documentation.
- 👯 I am looking to collaborate on Deep Learning + MLOps projects.
- 🌟 My interests: Computer Vision and Deep Learning, especially for mobile phone applications.
