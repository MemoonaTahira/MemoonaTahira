### Hi there 👋

<!--
**MemoonaTahira/MemoonaTahira** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I am Memoona Tahira! I am a freelance Machine Learning engineer. I am a Computer Science Graduate, and I researched in the domain of human psychology and Computer Vision. I like learning new things, especially how to automate coding tasks so I don't have to do it manually, and also to keep things updated on their own (for as long as possible).🧶

- 🔭 I have explored and created with **python**, **tensorflow**, **tflite**, **pytorch**, **torchscript**, **docker**, **GCP**, **git**, **pydoc documentation** as a deep learning tech stack. 
- 👀 Other languages: C++, MATLAB, VBA
- 🌱 I am currently learning with MLZoomcamp (a 4 months course by Data Talks). 
- 🐌 I am slowly mastering Docker, AWS, Streamlit, git and unit testing.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to read long posts and skim through code. I love well-documented code.  
- 🌟 My interests: Computer Vision and Deep Learning, especially for mobile phone applications. 
- 👯 I am looking to collaborate on Deep Learning + MLOps projects.
